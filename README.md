Path@Penn - Stage 4 HTML/CSS Prototype

This is a static phone sized mock up of the redesigned Path@Penn registration page using the calender split screen concept (course list on top + weekly calendar on bottom).

Per assignment rules, this is a single opening screen only. No JavaScript behavior is implemented.

How to run:
1. Download this folder (or the zip) to a computer.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser(ex chrome, safari, etc)

If you use VS Code, you can also install the live serve extension and click "go live" to open `index.html`.

files:
- index.html – the markup
- styles.css – the styling
- README.md – this file

- I used Google stich to help with the high fidelity interface, where I used prompted engineering and I used chat gpt 4.0 to explain concepts that I didn't know how to do yet in html/css coding, as well as online YouTube videos.
