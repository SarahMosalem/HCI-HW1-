# Path@Penn – Stage 4 HTML/CSS Prototype

This is a **static phone-sized mock** of the redesigned Path@Penn registration page using the **Calendar Split Screen** concept (course list on top + weekly calendar on bottom).

> Per assignment rules, this is a single opening screen only. No JavaScript behavior is implemented.

## How to run
1. Download this folder (or the zip) to your computer.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox). That’s it.

If you use VS Code, you can also install the **Live Server** extension and click *Go Live* to open `index.html`.

## Files
- `index.html` – the markup
- `styles.css` – the styling
- `README.md` – this file

## Attribution
- Structure and code were co-authored with ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking) based on a mock high-fidelity design created by Sarah Mosalem.
- All text, colors, and layout are for academic prototyping only.
